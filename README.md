# Playing with Discrete Fourier Transform
- [How does spectral analysis work](./SpectralAnalysis.ipynb)
- [Spectral Analysis of Clear Pitches](./ClearPitches.ipynb)
- [Spectral Analysis of Good Recording of Guitar Strings](./GuitarPitches.ipynb)

## Motivation
- after finishing the course on algorithms and data structures I was left wondering what exactly are the applications of DFT
- then at the end of a summer holiday I thought it may be a good idea to create a tuner
- so this repo has 2 purposes:
  - explore the DFT
  - create a tuner

## TODOs
- [x] explore HPS algorithm
- [ ] add bad guitar string recordings
- [ ] explore windowing (Hamming, Blackman, Square, Flat-top windows)
- [ ] create a pitch detector
- [ ] create a tuner
